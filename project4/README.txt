Program #4 â€“ Loops (Restaurant Bill)

Write a C++ program that calculates amount owed by customers in a restaurant. Start by asking for the number of people seated at the table. 
Then the program will ask the user for the price of each meal purchased at the table (you may assume that each person orders 1 all inclusive meal). 
The program will output a bill showing the subtotal, the sales tax, the tip, and the final total for the bill. 
Make sure the output is neat, clear, and clearly looks like money.

Your program should continue accepting new tables until a value of zero (0) is entered for a table.

Sales tax is calculated on the subtotal and is 7%. You should also calculate the tip based off the subtotal. 
The tip is 20% if the number of people at the table is six (6) or less. The tip 25% if there are more than six people.
