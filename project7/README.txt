Assignment Instructions:

Similar to your Program#6, your program should store the correct answers in an array. You may use that program as a starting point for this one. 
It should then read the answers for all the students from the file driving.dat. Please note that you do not know how many students have taken the exam. 
Those answers should be stored in a 2-Dimensional array. You should compare the correct array with the answers 2-D array. 
For each entry the program should store a value in a third 2-D parallel array of Boolean. 
If the answer is correct, the program should store true in the third array. If the answer was incorrect, the program should store false.

The program should then use the third 2-D array to determine the number of correct answers, the number of incorrect answers, and 
whether or not a student passed. (15 or more correct) You should have a function to score the student and separate functions that calculate the information
required in the output.

Please refer to Program #6 for the list of correct answers and output requirements.
