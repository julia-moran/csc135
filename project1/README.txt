Program #1 â€“ Introduction (Monthly Sales Tax)
  A retail company must file a monthly sales tax report listing the sales for the month and the amount of sales tax collected. 
  Write a program that asks for the month, the year, and the total amount collected at the cash register (that is, product sales plus sales tax). 
  The sales tax is split between the state and the county. Assume state sales tax is 4 percent and the county sales tax is 2 percent.

  If the total amount collected is known and the total sales tax is 6 percent, the amount of product sales is calculated using the formula:
  S = T/1.06
  where S is the product sales and T is the total income (product sales plus sales tax)
