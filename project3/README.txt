Program #3 â€“ Functions (Pressure Washing)

A pressure washing company has decided that every 60 square feet of siding they wash, one gallon of bleach is used. 
Additionally it will require three hours of labor, which costs $40.00 an hour. 
Write a program that will ask the user to enter the square footage and the cost of a gallon of bleach. 
The program should display the number of square feet to be washed, the cost of the bleach, the cost of labor, and the total cost.

Do not accept a value less than $3.00 per gallon for the price of bleach.

At a minimum write and call a function for each of the following tasks:

    Prompt for and return the area to be washed.
    Prompt for and return the price for a gallon of bleach.
        Your program should check the return value of this function in main. If the value is less than $3, have the program exit in main.
    Compute and return the cost for bleach used.
    Compute and return the cost of labor.
    Compute and return the total cost.
    Print the output.
